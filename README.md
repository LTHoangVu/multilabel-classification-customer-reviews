# Multilabel Classification of Customer Reviews on Tiki
This project was undertaken by my group as part of our Machine Learning course. We focused on skincare and makeup products on Tiki (E-commerce platform), aiming to classify reviews into 8 categories: delivery, packaging, color, service, smell, reliability, price, and texture.

Input: Review of customer on Tiki <br>
Output: Predict the labels that appear in the review

The process involved:

- Data collection using the TIKI API
- Labeling more than 3500 samples
- Consensus Estimation
- Data cleaning: removing stopwords, teencode, and correcting spelling errors
- Data visualization
- Data standardization: TF-IDF, Bag of Words, Word2Vec
- Prediction of results

In conclusion, we compared the importance of data cleaning and data standardization through detailed statistical analysis. Our contributions to this dataset are significant.
